=======================
python-TAMER
=======================

Python library containing functions as part of the Toolkit for Analysis and Maps of Exposure Risk (TAMER) project.

This is built on a template designed for gitlab and there are numerous aspects of development that have not been
completed. As such, the documentation at this stage is woeful and incorrect in a variety of ways. By the time we
release version 1.0, we will have formalised all documentation, but this is version 0.x and so it's not really
intended for public eyes at this stage.
